Greetings, fellow wizard!

I am a seeker of the secrets of ✨AI✨ magic.

I am currently enrolled in the International College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where I am studying the ancient art of Computer Science. 🖥️

I aspire to become a software developer and create spells and potions that can enchant the world. 👨‍💻

I have mastered the languages of Python, C, C++, Java, HTML and JavaScript, and I am always eager to learn new ones.(▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)

I am looking for a friend who shares my passion for coding and magic, and who can join me in my adventures. 🧙‍♂️

If you think you are the one, please send me an owl or a message. I promise I won't bite (unless you are a Slytherin). 😜
